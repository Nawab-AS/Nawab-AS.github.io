# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experience.

Why read this boring `README.md` when you can explore my projects directly through the terminal (or at least an emulator)?

## Is This a Template?
Although this is my personal portfolio, feel free to fork this repo and use this as a template for your own portfolio.
Just make sure to change the `githubUsername` and `email` variables in the `index.js` file to your own GitHub username and email address.
